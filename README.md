## GENOM project: Evolution of structural signatures in families of soluble protein domains

This repo was made for the GENOM project in the context of the M2 Bioinformatique et Mod√©lisation.
This project was done by Liam LG, Alexis T, and Yann Z.

The purpose of the project was the creation of a BLOSUM type matrix built from Pfam alignments of soluble domains obtained from SCOPe.
In order to create such a matrix, HCA (Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis) was used, and raw amino acid sequences were binarized according to a strong hydrophobic amino acid alphabet.

The test notebook contains the code for the creation of the full RP15 substitution matrix made on 3200+ Pfam alignments.
The tutorial notebook contains similar code but only on part of the data, with 2 Pfam alignments (that matched soluble domains with known 3D structures).
